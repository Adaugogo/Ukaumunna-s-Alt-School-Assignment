        I have upon graduation quickly learned that it is not solely about your
        grades in the job market. By gaining additional digital skills, I can
        leverage my skills in getting a good job at the very least but do you
        know what will sbsolutely make me happy? A remote job that will pay me
        enough to set up a new life in a small city. Right now, I have not
        decided on the city I would like to live in but my options are: The
        University towns- Ibadan and Nsukka. Ibadan for its proximity to Lagos
        and Nsukka for the nostalgia as it where I took my first degree. Also
        staying in these cities is a top choice for me as they house 2 of the
        top universities and this will be helpful if I feel like the timing is
        right to get my second degree. Ibadan is in the lead cause in addition,
        they have a program in Immunology and it is one train away from Lagos
        where my family home is.

    <h3>A Lagos Girl that hates Lagos.</h3>
    <p class="writing">
      Lagos- the city that housed my birth hospital. The city to which my
      umblical cord is attached, however, I am starved of nutrients.The housing
      condition, the crowd, the obsession with luxury in a deeply poor country-
      all drain me with reckless abandon. The ostentious display of wealth, even
      though, we can argue that this one is a Nigerian problem.
